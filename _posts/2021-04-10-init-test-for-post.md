[markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
